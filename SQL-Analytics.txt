Joining Tables

SELECT l.id as "loan.id", l.amount as "loan.amount", l.user_id, u.created as "user.created", transaction_fee, t_type
FROM users u JOIN loans l ON u.id = l.user_id
JOIN transactions t ON t.loan_id = l.id
WHERE (loan_status = 'active' or loan_status = 'repaid') AND (t_type = 'disbursement')
ORDER BY u.created DESC;

# First of all, I need to join three tables together. I chose to join users and loans based on the shared attribute of user_id. And I joined transactions table
# based on the loan_id.
# Secondly, I need to write the conditions. Since the question asks me to filter the loan status to "active" or "repaid", I specifiy the condition as 
# "loan_status = 'active' or loan_status = 'repaid'". Not only that, I also need to filter all the transaction type to 'disbursement'. So,I add a condition of 
# t_type = 'disbursement' and set the operand equals to 'AND' becuase these two conditions need to be satisfied at the same time.
# Thirdly, I order all the rows based on the desceding order of user creating date.
# Lastly, I display all the desired attributes: loan.id, loan.amount, user_id, user.created, transaction_fee, and t_type.



Aggregation

SELECT COUNT(id) as loan_number, SUM(amount) as amount_sum, AVG(amount) as amount_avg, MIN(amount) as smallest_loan, MAX(amount) as largest_loan
FROM loans
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created)
ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) DESC;

# First of all, I need to group all the data in loans table by the month of 'created' column. So, I proceed with EXTRACT function to get all the month value from
# the 'created' attribute.
# Secondly, I need to order all the value in the descending order fof the month becuase the question asks me to display the most recent month first.
# Lastly, I need to display all the desired attributes. To get the number of loans, I use the COUNT function. I use SUM function to get the total amount of
# all loans. And I write AVG function to get the average amount of each loan. Finally, I use MIN and MAX functions to get the smallest loan size and the largest 
# loan size per month.
